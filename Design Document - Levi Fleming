Data
● Image – 2D array of ints (size varies based on file)
● Current Image – 2D array of ints representing the current state of the image
● File pointers – inputImage, outputImage
● Brightness to Character Map – Dictionary mapping ints to chars
● Image Filename – string
● Image Dimensions – int rows, int columns

Game Play
User loads an image. Image data is reset. User views the image and provides edits. Image is
updated. If the user chooses to save, the edited image data is written to a file. User can continue editing or exit.

Functions
main()
● Data: Image, Current Image, File pointers, Brightness to Character Map
● Functionality: Load the image from the file. Display image. In a loop, allow user to
choose editing actions, update image, prompt to save or continue editing.

loadImage()
● Input Parameters: File pointer inputImage, int rows, int columns, int Image 2D array
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Load values from file into Image 2D array.

displayImage()
● Input Parameters: int rows, int columns, int Image 2D array
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Display a line. For each row, display the corresponding characters for each
cell in the row based on the Brightness to Character Map.

editImage()
● Input Parameters: int rows, int columns, int Current Image 2D array
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Display edit options. Repeat getting the user’s edit choice, update the
Current Image, display the image, and check to see if the user wants to save or continue
until the user chooses to exit editing.

saveImage()
● Input Parameters: File pointer outputImage, int rows, int columns, int Current Image 2D
array
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Write the Current Image data to a file as specified by the user.

cropImage()
● Input Parameters: int rows, int columns, int Current Image 2D array, int startRow, int
startCol, int endRow, int endCol
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Modify the Current Image by retaining only the section specified by the
input parameters.

dimImage()
● Input Parameters: int rows, int columns, int Current Image 2D array
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Decrease the brightness of each pixel in the Current Image by 1, not going
below 0.

brightenImage()
● Input Parameters: int rows, int columns, int Current Image 2D array
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Increase the brightness of each pixel in the Current Image by 1, not
exceeding 4.

rotateImage90Degrees()
● Input Parameters: int rows, int columns, int Current Image 2D array
● Returned Output: None
● Functionality: Rotate the Current Image by 90 degrees clockwise
