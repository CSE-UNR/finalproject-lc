Game Play
In the game play, users interact with a menu offering options such as loading a new image,
displaying the current image, editing the image, and exiting the program. When loading a new
image, users provide a filename, and the program attempts to read and display the image. Editing
options include cropping, dimming, brightening, and rotating the image, with the user prompted
to save their edits if desired. After each interaction, users are returned to the main menu until
they choose to exit the program, which concludes the gameplay loop.
